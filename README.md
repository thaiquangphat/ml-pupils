## Project Description

This project is dedicated to exploring medical classification using machine learning techniques. Our primary objective is to apply multiple machine learning models to a predefined dataset in order to classify medical data accurately and efficiently. To be specific, the work would be about classifying images into different types of tumor.

Through this process, our team seeks to analyze and compare each model based on multiple key metrics, including accuracy, execution time, variation, and overall performance. By evaluating these factors, we hope to uncover insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning approaches in handling data.

Ultimately, this project serves as a learning experience for our team, providing us with hands-on exposure to the practical application of machine learning in the computer vision. By systematically experimenting with different models, we aim to deepen our knowledge of their underlying mechanisms and improve our ability to select appropriate techniques for real-world problems.

Machine model our team focuses on include:

- [Decision Tree](#decison-tree)
- [Aritificial Neural Network (ANN)](#artificial-neural-network-ann)
- [Naive Bayesian](#naive-bayesian)
- [Genetic Algorithm (GA)](#genetic-algorithm-ga)
- [Bayesian Network](#bayesian-network)
- [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](#support-vector-machine-svm)
- [Dimension Reduced LDA or PCA](#dimension-reduced-lda-or-pca)
- [Bagging and Boosting](#bagging-and-boosting)

For this study, we will be utilizing the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset serves as the foundation for our exploration, enabling us to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches in medical image classification.
